# Title
# Introduction
This is our first group project. Our goal is to make an application that will show current weather conditions and forecast for a city of the users choosing. The app will also list events coming up for that city and allow the user to purchase tickets through Ticket Master. Our aim is to display thumbnails for the  events on a carousel.
