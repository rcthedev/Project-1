# C.C.M.R. Travel
Best portal for events and travel!

## Introduction
This is our first group training project. Our goal is to make an application that will show current weather conditions and forecast for a city of the users choosing. The app will also list events coming up for that city and allow the user to purchase tickets through Ticket Master. Our aim is to display thumbnails for the  events on a carousel.

## About Us
Our Vision: Provide a simple and easy to use event planer web application.

Our Mission: To make a user friendly experience by simplifying event planning and integrating all aspects of booking your travel and event needs.
